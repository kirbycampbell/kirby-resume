 To finish I'd like to add transitions to the phoneView when opening and closing the sections. Also, I'd like to add little plus signs to show that the sections can be opened. Also I need to slim down the Projects section and only put the name of the project... and when a user hovers it shows the framework info fade in with opacity. On Phones it can have a little plus sign on it for the exrta info and an open button. The School education section can have a link to my flatiron certificate and my GPA standing in school. Each Skill can have a blog post of mine associated with it. Work experience can have links as well. Perhaps even when highlighted. Also need to make COntact info clickable. My face and name should take you to jkirbycampbell.com as well. Three bars on phoneview should give the option for Blog, Share, Print, Contact, and Github.
