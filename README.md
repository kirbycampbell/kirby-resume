Hi!

This is an interactive web resume created with custom CSS & HTML only, using React to quickly render all responsive items to the screen!

The main view for this app can be viewed at [DesktopView.js](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/kirby-resume/blob/master/src/DesktopView/DesktopView.js) within this project. Material ui helps me render entirely different html/css content depending on the size of the screen, instead of using css queries.

Live Version of this app is viewable at: [Kirby Campbell's Resume](https://resume-app.jkirbycampbell.com/)

Feel free to contact me at jkirbycampbell@gmail.com for job inqueries.
